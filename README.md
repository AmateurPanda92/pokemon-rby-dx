   <h3><b>Sister project:</b> <a href="https://www.github.com/AmateurPanda92/understanding-pokemon-red-english-translation">Pok√©mon Red ‚Äì Detailed Disassembly Documentation üìö</a></h3>
   <p>I recently stumbled upon <a href="https://www.github.com/pokemium">@pokemium</a>‚Äôs superb, albeit WIP, resource <a href="https://www.github.com/pokemium/understanding-pokemon-red">Ë©≥Ëß£„Éù„Ç±„É¢„É≥Ëµ§ / ‚ÄúUnderstanding Pok√©mon Red‚Äù</a> and I‚Äôve started work on translating it to English (the repo linked above). I‚Äôll work on continuing this translation effort as I go through this project, as in doing so, it‚Äôll become more useful as source code documentation to anyone working on RBY DX, and I may even be able to contribute back some original research of my own to help fill-in any gaps in the original repo‚Äôs information.</p>
</div>

---

_(**tl;dr** ‚Äì if you just want to try the ROMs out, the [releases](https://github.com/AmateurPanda92/pokemon-rby-dx/releases) tab contains pre-compiled binaries of each version which you can download as is and try-out in any decent GBC emulator.)_

This is a work-in-progress fan-made [ROM hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROM_hacking) of the [first-generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(video_game_series)#First_generation_(1996%E2%80%931999)) [Pok√©mon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon) [games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok√©mon_(video_game_series)), which were originally developed for the [Nintendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo) [Game Boy (DMG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) and are planned here to be enhanced specifically for the Nintendo [Game Boy Color (GBC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color). All backwards compatibility with the original Game Boy will be removed so that it doesn‚Äôt hold-back what the games might be capable of imagining they were originally intended to be GBC-exclusive titles.

The inspiration for this project comes from the likes of the excellent fan-made DX/‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù ROM hacks such as [_Super Mario Land DX_](http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/4477) and [_Super Mario Land 2 DX_](http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3784), which in turn were likely inspired by official upgraded titles back in the day like [_Tetris DX_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_(Game_Boy)#Tetris_DX) and [_The Legend of Zelda: Link‚Äôs Awakening DX_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Link%27s_Awakening). These offer full [15-bit colour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color#Summary), usually fixes for well-known bugs in the original DMG counterparts and often additional features, such as new playable characters, new gameplay modes, improved sprite graphics, extra levels, peripheral integration, game mechanics that mandate the use of colour, and so on.

In essence, I want to make this game as polished as might have been possible back in the day if the limitations of the original weren‚Äôt as strict, i.e. if they didn‚Äôt have to worry about manufacturing costs on a commercial scale, didn‚Äôt have to worry about delivering a product in a certain timeframe, could use the maximum number of [ROM banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_switching), could exploit the [extra processing power and RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color#Specifications) of the GBC and weren‚Äôt limited to the monochrome DMG colour palette. I do still want the game to _feel_ like the 1<sup>st</sup>-gen games though, so I will have to draw a line somewhere regarding upgrades, for instance, I doubt I‚Äôll add features like the [in-battle experience points progress bar](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver_Versions#Graphics), otherwise this might detract from the game feeling authentic.

This project is based-on the superb split-assemblies of [Red, Blue](https://www.github.com/pret/pokered) and [Yellow](https://www.github.com/pret/pokeyellow) created by the [pret](https://www.github.com/pret) collective, and wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without their contributions to the scene, so a **huge** thanks to all of them! The list of contributors to each of these repositories can be found here:

* https://www.github.com/pret/pokered/graphs/contributors
* https://www.github.com/pret/pokeyellow/graphs/contributors

As it stands, this project is very much a work-in-progress ‚Äì so much so that there haven‚Äôt yet been any changes to the source code, so building the repository will result in two binaries that are bit-perfect copies of known-good dumps of the official releases of Blue and Red (see below). As such, my first goal with this project will be to have a play with the shiny new [GitHub Actions](https://www.github.com/features/actions) platform and get it building the source automatically. As of [v0](https://github.com/AmateurPanda92/pokemon-rby-dx/releases/tag/v0) of this project, the ROMs generated will be the following named entries from the [Cowering GoodTools](http://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/GoodTools) database, and associated message-digest hash, where the _‚Äú(UE)‚Äù_, _‚Äú[S]‚Äù_ and _‚Äú[!]‚Äù_ [codes](http://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/GoodTools#Good_codes) indicate that the ROM binary is for the USA and Europe regions, has special [Super Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Game_Boy) integration and is an exact copy of the original game without modifications respectively:

* _‚ÄúPokemon Red (UE) [S][!].gb‚Äù_ (MD5: `3d45c1ee9abd5738df46d2bdda8b57dc`)
* _‚ÄúPokemon Blue (UE) [S][!].gb‚Äù_ (MD5: `50927e843568814f7ed45ec4f944bd8b`)

I will always be keeping this README up-to-date with the state of the codebase, so this will remain a reliable single point-of-truth for the project‚Äôs status. Note that this project is primarily a learning tool for me to teach myself GB(C) development and gain more experience with coding in assembly. That being said, I more than welcome contributors to come and get involved, so please do get in-touch (probably via [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/andiemmadavies) is best) if you‚Äôre interested in helping-out!

## Goals

The following is a fairly comprehensive, but not necessarily exhaustive, list of what I‚Äôm striving to achieve with this project, sorted into rough categories‚Ä¶

### Development

* I‚Äôm looking to develop this hack using **modern development tools and methodologies**, including (but not limited to): [open source](https://www.opensource.com/resources/what-open-source), task tracking and management, community engagement, full version control, [SemVer](https://semver.org/) version numbering scheme, [feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow), peer code review, collaborative coding tools, automated build process, separate debug and release build configurations, automated testing (if practical), [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD), develop new tooling, crowd-sourced pre-release testing, ongoing public documentation efforts, etc.
* I plan for changes to be **implemented roughly in the order players will first experience them in-game**, so that demo and preview builds are already close to 100% polished up to a certain point of in-game progress, i.e. I‚Äôll start with the copyrights screen, then the Game Freak logo, opening cutscene, title screen, and so on.
* One of the earliest changes I‚Äôd like to make is to **add a version number indicator to the title screen**, so that each build in the wild is clearly distinguishable by just loading the game. I‚Äôd also like to get the necessary scaffolding set-up for this version number to be automatically set at build time, so that releases automatically show their correct version number in-game.
* As and when they become necessary, I‚Äôll add **bespoke in-game debugging tools**, which will only be available when built via the debug build config.

### Compatibility

* The key change here is that I will **immediately ditch DMG backwards compatibility**, so that the hack can exploit all the GBC-exclusive hardware goodies.
* **Real hardware support**, with the hope of eventually getting some **real cartridges manufactured** (maybe even with new box designs and the like too).
* Maintain (and expand on) **full [Game Link Cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Link_Cable) compatibility**, including:
  * Support for using the **[Game Boy Printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Printer)**:
    * Print **[stickers](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Game_Boy_Printer#Pok.C3.A9dex_stickers) of every Pok√©mon** in the Pok√©dex, featuring their updated sprite graphics.
    * Print a custom **completed-Pok√©dex [diploma](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Game_Boy_Printer#Diploma)**, featuring special graphics for the completing it on the DX editions.
    * Print a list of **Pok√©mon stored in a [Storage System](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Game_Boy_Printer#Pok.C3.A9mon_Storage_System) box**, as in the originals.
    * Print [**party Pok√©mon ‚Äúphotos‚Äù**](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Game_Boy_Printer#Party_Pok.C3.A9mon) when visiting the chairman of the Pok√©mon Fan Club in Vermillion City.
    * In addition, I‚Äôd like to be able to **add GB Printer support to the Red and Blue editions**, as only Yellow featured printing functionality in the original releases.
  * **Full trade and colosseum compatibility** with both 1<sup>st</sup>- and 2<sup>nd</sup>-gen (via the [Time Capsule](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Time_Capsule)) mainstream Pok√©mon games (English-language versions only).
  * I probably **won‚Äôt keep support for interacting w/ Pok√©mon Stadium**, as I have to draw the line somewhere. Plus, this would be an absolute nightmare to debug, if not impossible for anyone without an N64 development kit! You never know, it may JustWork‚Ñ¢ if I‚Äôm lucky and don‚Äôt make too many alterations to memory locations for existing Pok√©mon data.
  * Ultimately, I don‚Äôt want this game to be considered a gimmick. I‚Äôd like it to be able to interact with the official games, as if it were an official release itself.
  * (Maybe even some currently unimagined uses that could be explored in future too‚Ä¶)
* Brand **new custom [Super Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Game_Boy) borders** for each of the three editions.

### Fixes

* **Fix as many [well-known bugs](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_glitches_in_Generation_I) and [oversights](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Generation_I#Issues_and_bugs) as possible** from the originals, especially those that cause game instability or make it impossible to progress without starting a new game.
* **Fix any bad Japanese to English translations**.
* I will also make the necessary changes to **stop it being possible to perform a variety of glitches** like the [Mew glitch](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mew_glitch), mostly for stability and completeness, so the game feels polished, plus they likely won‚Äôt work the same once memory locations start to shift anyway.
* I aim to **fix newly-introduced bugs as a priority** before starting work on new features, otherwise everything will quickly become an unplayable mess!

### Graphics

* The obvious one: **full colour everywhere**!
* **Background graphics** (or at least colours) for battles, cutscenes, etc.
* All **new Pok√©mon sprites**, both for in-battle (front and back, designed to more closely resemble the anime-inspired art style that became the standard after Red and Blue were released) and in the party menu.
* Maybe **double the resolution of the rear-facing battle sprites**?
* **Fly and Surf graphics that show the actual Pok√©mon** that performed the move in the overworld, rather than just the generic Seel and Pidgey graphics.
* **HP bar which gradually changes colour** from green to red, like in Yellow but even more gradually.
* **Tweaked trainer sprites**, to be more in-line with the anime aesthetic that the new Pok√©mon sprites will be designed to adhere to.
* **Antialiased text** and other UI elements like **menu and textbox borders** (might be too ambitious). Maybe support for [variable-width fonts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm7Iv4aKFGk)?

### Audio

* Sound will largely remain unchanged. It should, however, be possible to **improve the sound quality of Pikachu‚Äôs cry and voice clips** in Yellow: can double the sample rate, since the game can now use the GBC-exclusive double CPU clock speed and can utilise more ROM banks to store higher-resolution samples. Might also be able to squeeze some less harsh downsampling out of the effective 2-bit (variable amplitude) bit depth by playing around with different dithering methods and input levels when re-encoding the sound data. This is all assuming I can get hold of the original, uncompressed voice samples from somewhere ([Retro Game Mechanics Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fooSxCuWvZ4) managed to find them somewhere).
* There appears to exist at least one **unused hidden track** in the original ROM data, which could potentially be used for a new feature addition to the game.
* Could maybe port the **2<sup>nd</sup>-gen games‚Äô audio engine** over, in order to be able to use the richer instrument sounds (possibly with a user option to select which version they‚Äôd prefer to hear).

### UI/UX

* Add **UI niceties** that were added in future generations, such as:
  * **Select button quick items** (e.g. for bicycle).
  * **Press A to interact with objects** like cuttable trees, boulders, etc.
  * **Signposts** that appear onscreen **when you enter a new area**.
  * [**Run by holding ‚ÄòB‚Äô**](https://www.github.com/pret/pokered/wiki/Running-Shoes), similar to the running shoes introduced in gen-3.
  * [**Turning to face enemy trainers when seen**](https://www.github.com/pret/pokered/wiki/Turn-to-face-enemy-trainers-when-seen-by-them), introduced in the non-remake 3<sup>rd</sup>-gen games.
  * **Turbo mode** that makes use of the GBC‚Äôs double clock speed compared to the DMG, giving players the option to speed-up gameplay like they‚Äôd be able to if using an emulator. It might not be possible to double the clock speed at run time, so one way this might be possible is to always run the game at double clock speed and limit the speed at which graphics and audio are updated.
* **UX behaviour tweaks** and other **quality-of-life improvements** to address minor friction points that negatively affect the player‚Äôs enjoyment, for example:
  * Allowing the player to **cancel playing the bicycle music** by pressing ‚ÄòB‚Äô when riding the bike to revert to the music attributed to the area they are in, similar to the effect moving into a new area while still on the bike would have.
  * Removing or [**reducing the artificial save delay**](https://www.github.com/pret/pokered/wiki/Remove-Artificial-Save-Delay).

### Events

* Plan some cool new in-game event that makes it **possible to catch a genuine Mew** without the Mew glitch (as I plan to [patch that glitch out](#Fixes)). Maybe Mew actually _is_ [under the truck](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/02/that-time-some-players-thought-mew-was-under-a-truck-inpokmon) after all!?
* An in-game event that makes it possible to catch a **genuine surfing Pikachu** without requiring the use of Pok√©mon Stadium (as I plan to [remove support for it](#Compatibility)) and a Transfer Pak; maybe make it a single field encounter like with the other legendaries?
* Restore the long-lost **final battle with Oak**, and other [speculated cut content/features](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Professor_Oak#Unused_teams).

### Extras

* **Cameos and Easter eggs**? Maybe some anime references? _‚ÄúAsh was here‚Äù_ for instance? Staff and contributor battles?
* I‚Äôve often thought about developing **a version of the gen-I games which closely matches the anime**, so maybe this will serve as a good base for that when this project is largely finished? Who knows!
* After beating the game, maybe **provide limited access to Johto via the SS Aqua** like at the end of Gold/Silver/Crystal, to tie the generations together? Maybe [v2](#Roadmap) could let you play _all_ of Johto with similar enhancements? Also Gold and Silver still had DMC compatibility, so the gen-II games didn‚Äôt make use of all colour that was available to it, nor did it use the extra RAM and processing power. Crystal made use of some of the extra RAM or processing power I believe, in order to do the animated in-battle Pok√©mon sprites but I don‚Äôt think it added any additional colour usage (unless I can find evidence to the contrary), so Johto could equally be enhanced colour and graphics wise.
* [v3](#Roadmap) could include **support for trading and battling with gen-III**, possibly by developing some custom hardware that bridges the different link cable versions, which would allow for genuine trading between generations so that genuine gen-I/II Pok√©mon could be traded forward to official gen-III games.

## Versions

### Numbering

The versioning scheme for this project is loosely based around [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), where the version number is split into up to five parts:

1. _**Major** number_ ‚Äì this is incremented when the codebase has significantly changed since its last major revision, i.e. for the final version, then for each major new release-worthy set of changes, such as new regions to explore, new game mechanics, etc. Incrementing this number resets the minor, patch and pre-release parts to zero/unspecified.
2. _**Minor** number (optional, prefixed by a full stop, must be present if patch number is specified)_ ‚Äì this is incremented every time there has been a new feature added or the codebase has undergone a large refactor. Incrementing this number resets the patch and pre-release parts to zero/unspecified.
3. _**Patch** number (optional, prefixed by a full stop, must be present if pre-release label is specified)_ ‚Äì this is incremented whenever a bug gets fixed or a small feature/refactor has been implemented. Incrementing this number resets the pre-release parts to zero/unspecified.
4. _**Pre-release label** string (optional, prefixed by a hyphen, must be present if pre-release revision is specified)_ ‚Äì this is set whenever a version of the codebase is made available for others to test, and can be one of three values (in order of precedence): _‚Äúalpha‚Äù_ (early public preview), _‚Äúbeta‚Äù_ (feature freeze for bug-bashing) and _‚Äúrc‚Äù_ (release candidate, i.e. the version of the code to be released unless any bugs emerge in the meantime). Promoting this label to the next value resets the pre-release revision to zero/unspecified.
5. _**Pre-release revision** number (optional, prefixed by a full stop)_ ‚Äì this is set whenever a pre-release stage needs updates applying to it and is incremented for each time this needs to happen.

### Releases

_(There have been no releases yet; watch this space!)_

### Roadmap

I plan to keep chipping-away at this project for years to come, hence some of the wildly ambitious future major version update ideas below! This is my current list of aspirations for the project, along with rough associated version numbers:

* **v0** - the original, unmodified game (used primarily for testing CI/CD with GitHub Actions).
* **v0.0.x** - initial set of codebase-tidying refactors.
* **v0.1** - runs in GBC-exclusive mode.
* **v0.1.1** - proof-of-concept with some change that proves that more than DMG colours are available to the game.
* **v0.2** - first proper user-visible change (which will probably be changes to the copyright screen).
* **v0.x** - incremental feature upgrades (in the order outlined previously).
* **v0.y-alpha** - initial publicised demo (with areas restricted using feature flags for stability). Maybe cut-off once you‚Äôre allowed to go into the grass properly after Oak‚Äôs already dragged you inside the lab and you‚Äôve battled Blue.
* **v0.z-beta** - the vast majority of, if not all, new features have been developed, to the point where the game can be completed and there‚Äôs always something new visible, but there will likely be lots of bugs to be squashed. It‚Äôs at this point we‚Äôll be appealing for beta testers to help get the game ready for its initial [GA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#General_availability_(GA)) release.
* **v1-rc** - release candidate for the first full release of the game. If no bugs are found between the publishing of this version and the release date, then this will be the version of the code that gets promoted to full release as v1.
* **v1** - first completed release of the game, to be published with an accompanying [github.io](https://pages.github.com/) website and advertising campaign of sorts.
* **v1.0.x** - post-release bug fixes to the original feature set of v1. No new features.
* **v1.x** - new feature development approaching v2.
* **v2** - the next major iteration of the game; practically a standalone new hack. This could be something like adding the Johto region to the game.
* **v3** - maybe something super-ambitious and technically challenging that extends beyond just the software, such as to support trading with the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation games, something that was never officially supported?
* **vX** - who knows!!

## Development guidelines

2. Set the working directory to the root of the repository, replacing `<path-to-repo>` with the path to said repository root:
   * `cd <path-to-repo>`
3. Issue the following commands to generate the desired output binaries to the repo‚Äôs root directory (note that this will take a while on first build, but builds are incremental, so only changed source files will be recompiled when run again):
   * `make red` ‚Äì generates a **Red-version** binary with a filename of _‚Äúpokered.gbc‚Äù_.
   * `make blue` ‚Äì generates a **Blue-version** binary with a filename of _‚Äúpokeblue.gbc‚Äù_.
   * `make` ‚Äì generates binaries for **both** versions with filenames of _‚Äúpokered.gbc‚Äù_ and _‚Äúpokeblue.gbc‚Äù_ respectively.

### Running

As far as I know, [mGBA](https://www.mgba.io/) is the most accurate GBx emulator for PC that is still in active development, so this is the one I‚Äôm going to be using as a reference emulator and what I recommend contributors use as well. Download the 64-bit Windows archive of the [latest release](https://www.github.com/mgba-emu/mgba/releases/latest) (e.g. _‚ÄúmGBA-X.Y.Z-win32.7z‚Äù_, where _‚ÄòX‚Äô_, _‚ÄòY‚Äô_ and _‚ÄòZ‚Äô_ are the three parts of the version number), extract it using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), run mGBA and open one of the game binaries that was built from the steps in the previous section in order to test the game and any changes made.

If you‚Äôre not a PC user, mGBA has builds for macOS and Ubuntu too, so that should cover most bases if you develop on a different platform. There are tonnes of good open-source emulators out there though, so do some digging and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find one that does the job‚Ä¶

## Wiki

There is now a [repository wiki](https://www.github.com/AmateurPanda92/pokemon-rby-dx/wiki) that contains more detailed information about project specifics than on this README. We‚Äôll add to it as and when there are new aspects of the project that need documenting, and it‚Äôll eventually become a one-stop shop for information pertaining to the project. It might even be possible in future for any original research to be shared back to the wider ROM hacking community too.

At the time of writing (5<sup>th</sup> January 2021), these are the existing sections and sub-pages on the wiki‚Ä¶
